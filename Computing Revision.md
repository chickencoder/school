Desigining databases
====================

A dataabase is stored in a format such as CSV and is stored on the harddrive.

When desigining a database it is important to decide what the structure will be before you start adding data. It is difficult to change a datasbase's structure.
Databases organise data in tables.

## Flat-file databases
A flat-file database is a database which is represented as a table in a file.
