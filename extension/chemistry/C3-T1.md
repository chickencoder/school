Qualitative Analysis
====================

**Qualitative Analysis** is investigating the chemicals and compounds that are present in a sample.

**Quantitative Analysis** is investigating how much of these compounds are present in a sample.

## Analytical Chemistry
Analytical chemistry is used in monitoring the constituents of the blood and in water treatment facilities to make sure water is safe to drink.

### Testing ionic compounds
In order to identify a mystery ionic compound, it must be tested for different ions.

#### Testing for positive ions
**NaOH** can used to test for positive ions in a simple reaction since a coloured precipitate should be produced.

| "Metal"                         | Colour of precipitate                |
|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Calcium **Ca<sup>2+</sup>**     | White                                |
| Copper (ii) **Cu<sup>2+</sup>** | Blue                                 |
| Iron (ii) **Fe<sup>2+</sup>**   | Green                                |
| Iron (iii) **Fe<sup>3+</sup>**  | Brown                                |
| Aluminium **Al<sup>3+</sup>**   | White (redissolves with excess NaOH) |

If ammonium is present, not precipitate will be formed but ammonia gas will be given off. This can be identified with damp litmus paper which will turn purple in the presence of ammonia.

#### Testing for halides
Halide ions (Chloride, Bromide, Iodide) can be tested for by reacting them with dilute nitric acid followed by silver nitrate solution.

A **chloride** gives a white precipitate...
```
Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq) -> AgCl(s)
```
<br>
A **bromide** gives a cream precipitate...
```
Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) -> AgBr(s)
```
<br>
An **iodide** gives a cream precipitate...
```
Ag+(aq) + I-(aq) -> AgI(s)
```

**Reminder:** Other tests include flame tests, carbonate tests and sulfate tests.
