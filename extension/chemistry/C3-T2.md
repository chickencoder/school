Quantitative Analysis
=====================

A <u>mole</u> is the number **6.023 x 10<sup>23</sup>**.

We use this number because when you get that number of particles, the mass of the any element or compound will be the same number of grams as the relative mass (M<sub>r</sub> or A<sub>r</sub>).

The **molar mass** of a substance is just the mass of one mole of that substance. So, since the relative atomic mass of a carbon-12 atom is 12, the molar mass of that atom will be 12g.

### Mole Calculations
```
Mass = Number of Moles x Mr
```
... or **My name's Mr**.

#### Example:
**What is the mass in grams of 3.5 moles of magnesium?**

M<sub>r</sub> of Mg = 24, Number of moles = 3.5

In order to find the mass we need to times the number of moles by the M<sub>r</sub>.

```
  24 x 3.5 = 84g
```
